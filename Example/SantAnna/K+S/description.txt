Labor- and finance-augmented K+S Model (version 5.1)
====================================================

This version copyright by Marcelo C. Pereira.
The K+S original code was developed by Andrea Roventini and other contributors.

This is a full rewrite of the original "Schumpeter meeting Keynes" (K+S) model, plus the labor and finance extensions, to LSD. Differently from previous versions, the entire legacy part of the model was updated to regular LSD equations. There is no guarantee this version matches the results of previous versions exactly, due to intrinsic differences between programming approaches.

Due to the size of the model, it is strongly recommended that 64-bit of LSD version 7.2+ be used. Slow execution speed and possible out-of-memory errors are to be expected when used in legacy 32-bit version.

Model description
=================

The K+S model is a general disequilibrium, stock-and-flow consistent, agent-based model, populated by heterogeneous workers, firms, and banks which behave according to bounded-rational rules. This experimental set-up allows for an in-depth, simultaneous analysis of the macro- and microeconomic dynamics, including the growth paths of the productivity and the GDP, and details on the coupled operation of labor and financial markets. 

The three-sector economy in the K+S model is composed by four populations of heterogeneous agents: consumers/workers, capital-good firms, consumption-good firms, and banks, plus the central bank and the government. Capital-good firms invest in R&D and produce heterogeneous machine-tools whose productivity evolves endogenously and stochastically over time. Consumption-good firms combine machines bought from capital-good firms and labor in order to produce a single, quality-differentiated good for consumers. The banking sector is represented by a fixed number of banks that take deposits and provide interest-paying loans to finance firms' production and investment plans. Workers search for jobs at a random subset of (non-bank) firms. Capital- and consumer-good firms hire workers according to their individual adaptive demand expectations. The central bank sets the prime interest rate, takes compulsory reserves from the banks and bails out failing banks. The government levies taxes on firms and banks profits, pays unemployment benefits, provides training for the unemployed, imposes a minimum wage, absorbs excess profits and losses from the central bank and keeps a non-explosive public debt trajectory in the long run. 

The capital-good sector is the locus of endogenous innovation in the model. Capital-good firms develop new machine-embodied techniques or imitate the ones of their closer competitors in order to produce and sell more productive and cheaper machinery. On demand, they supply universal-application machine-tools to consumption-good firms, producing with labor as the only input. Firms have access to bank loans to cover their possible liquidity requirements up to a ceiling. The capital-good market is characterized by imperfect information and Schumpeterian competition driven by technological innovation. Firms signal the price and productivity of machines to their current customers as well as to a small set of potential new ones, and invest a fraction of past revenues in R&D aimed at searching for new machines or copy existing ones. Prices are set using a fixed mark-up over (labor) costs of production. 

Consumption-good firms produce a single, quality-differentiated good employing machines and labor under constant returns to scale. The physical capital stock is composed by a set of machine-tool "vintages" associated with different labor productivities. Desired production is determined according to adaptive demand expectations. Given the actual inventories of the consumer good, if the current capital stock is not sufficient to produce the desired output, firms order new machines to expand their installed capacity. Machine-tool orders are paid in advance by drawing on retained past profits or, up to some limit, on bank loans. Moreover, firms replace old machines according to a payback-period rule. As new capital embed state-of-the-art technologies, the labor productivity of consumption-good firms increases over time according to the mix of (employed) vintages in the capital stock. Firms choose the capital-good suppliers comparing price and productivity of the machines they are aware of. Consumer-good prices are fixed via a variable mark-up rule over the (labor) production costs, balancing profit margins and market shares. Firms increase their mark-up rate whenever the market share is expanding and vice versa. Imperfect information is also the normal state of the consumption-good market so consumers do not instantaneously switch to the most competitive producer. Market shares evolve according to a (quasi) replicator dynamics: more competitive firms expand, while low competitiveness firms shrink, or exit the market. Firms' competitiveness is derived from individual price, unfilled demand and product quality.

The process of firm entry-exit is entirely endogenous in both industrial sectors. Firms leave whenever market shares get close to zero or net assets turn negative (bankruptcy). Conversely, the (stochastic) number of entrants depends on the number of incumbents and on the prevailing financial conditions. When the sectoral liquidity-to-debt ratio is growing, new firms find it easier to enter, and vice versa.

Banks collect deposits from firms and evaluate the provision of loans on request. Firms in both real sectors hold a fixed relationship with a (randomly-chosen) single bank. The supply of credit is bounded by each bank's capital and Basel-type regulatory capital-adequacy constraints. The available credit is allocated by each bank according to a pecking order whereby demanding clients are ranked by their liquidity-to-sales ratio. Credit rationed firms are not able to fully accomplish their investment plans.

The central bank fixes the prime interest rate using a single or dual mandate Taylor rule, depending on the policy set-up. A share of banks' deposits are held by the central bank as compulsory reserves. The interest rate structure is such that the prime rate stands between the interest rate on deposits, as the lower bound, the interest rate on bank reserves, and the rate on loans, as the upper bound. The latter are defined according to mark-down and mark-up rules on the prime, respectively. Central bank bails out the banking sector whenever the total net worth turns negative by absorbing the failed bank liabilities and injecting a fixed amount of new capital. As the model is stock-flow consistent: the bail-out costs correspond to an increase of government expenditure and, likely, to an increment of the public debt. As banks do not repay bail-out funds, the associated expenses worsen the conditions of public finance, potentially violating the set fiscal rules, thus triggering government expenditure cuts. However, as bail-outs repeat over time, the accumulated debt must be repaid to ensure a balanced public debt growth path. Hence the target tax rate is calibrated accordingly.

The labor market is modeled as a fully-decentralized search and hiring process between workers and firms. Banks, the central bank and the government occupy no workers. The aggregate supply of labor may be fixed or not and all workers are available to be hired in any period. Workers may present learn-by-using (machine operation) vintage skills, learning-by-doing (on-the-job) tenure skills, or both. Firm productivity may be also affected by the skills of their workers. Unemployed workers may get government-supplied training to preserve/update skills. When unemployed, workers submit a certain number of job applications to firms. Employed workers may apply or not for better positions, according to the institutional set-up. Larger firms have a proportionally higher probability of receiving job applications, which are collected in separated, firm-specific application queues. The labor market is characterized by imperfect information as firms only observe workers' skills and wage requests over their own queues, and workers are aware only of the wage offers they may receive from firms where they applied for a job.

Firms, on the grounds of the received orders (capital-good sector), the expected demand (consumption-good sector), and the current labor productivity levels, decide whether to (i) hire new workers, (ii) fire part of the existing ones, or (iii) keep the employees. Each hiring firm defines a unique wage offer for the applicant workers, based on current mark-ups and the received applications. Workers select the best wage offer they get from firms to which they submitted applications, if any. When already employed, depending on the institutional regime, they may quit the current job if a better  offer is available. There are no further rounds of bargaining between workers and firms in the same period. Thus, firms have no guarantee of fulfilling all the open positions, workers may not find a job even when there are still unfilled positions, and no labor market clearing is ever guaranteed. Moreover, there are no firing or hiring transaction costs. Firm productivity and product quality may be also affected by the skills of the workers. 

Workers of firms presenting above-average profits may receive a share of the positive free cash flows as bonus, proportionally to their individual wages. The remaining free cash flows are paid to a group of non-worker, firm-owner individuals, if workers are not shareholders, or kept available to be distributed as dividends to worker-shareholders, otherwise. Employed workers receive heterogeneous wages and, when in top-profit firms, may also get profit-sharing bonuses. Unemployed workers may get unemployment benefits from the government. Workers try to fully spend their income on the consumption good. If total supply of the consumer good is insufficient to satisfy the resulting demand, the excess is saved in banks and turns into additional consumption in the next period(s). Workers cannot get credit from banks for consumption. 

The model is fully stock-and-flow consistent. Entrant firm's capital can be derived from a mix between bank debt and (shareholder) workers income, according to the configuration. When workers are also shareholders, government may be forced to bail-out them if accumulated (forced) savings get negative. 

The model supports an institutional change (shock) at a predefined time step. When it occurs, for a period a fraction of new firms are introduced in the market using a different configuration from the existing firms ("post-change" vs. "pre-change" types). When the hold on period is over, the probability of an entrant firm to belong to one of the two groups is given by the joint market share of that group.


Example configurations
======================

The model come with some ready-to-use configuration files (.lsd extension), illustrating some of the possible set-ups:

No-skills-Prod_hom-Min_fin-Seed_cap.lsd = no worker/firm skills, homogeneous consumer-good, minimal financial market (fixed interest rate, no bank credit limit, no fiscal policy), seed firms capital from workers equity

No_skills-Prod_hom-Min_fin-Bank_cap.lsd = no worker/firm skills, homogeneous consumer-good, minimal financial market (fixed interest rate, no bank credit limit, no fiscal policy), firms capital from bank debt

Ten_skills-Prod_qual-Min_fin-Bank_cap.lsd = workers tenure skills, heterogeneous quality consumer-good, minimal financial market (fixed interest rate, no bank credit limit, no fiscal policy), firms capital from bank debt

Ten_skills-Prod_qual-Fin-Bank_cap.lsd = workers tenure skills, heterogeneous quality consumer-good, active financial market (interest structure, Taylor rule prime rate, Basel-like bank credit limit), firms capital from bank debt

Ten_skills-Prod_qual-Full_fin-Bank_cap.lsd = workers tenure skills, heterogeneous quality consumer-good, fully active financial market (interest structure, Taylor rule prime rate, Basel-like bank credit limit and deficit/debt active fiscal policy), firms capital from bank debt

All set-ups include a regulatory shock at t=200. New, post-change entrant firms compete with the existing pre-change incumbents. The parameters affected by the shock are identified by the suffix "Chg" in the names.


R analysis scripts
==================

There are several R scripts (.R extension inside R subdirectory) ready to analyze the simulation results:

KS-aggregates.R = overall analysis of macroeconomic aggregates, including scenario comparison, time series plots, de-trended series growth stationarity, temporal correlation structure, hysteresis measures, Monte Carlo experiments comparison (distribution and performance)

KS-sector-1.R = pooled and Monte Carlo firm-level analysis of the capital-good sector, including scenario statistics comparison, size, productivity and growth rate empirical plots and fits to Gaussian, Laplace and Subbotin distributions

KS-sector-2-pool.R = pooled firm-level analysis of the consumption-good sector, including scenario statistics comparison, Gibrat-law and scaling-variance tests, and size, productivity and growth rate empirical plots and fits to Gaussian, Laplace and Subbotin distributions

KS-sector-2-MC.R = Monte Carlo firm-level analysis of the capital-good sector, including scenario statistics comparison, productivity dynamics among groups of firms, FHK and DN productivity decompositions, and parametric/non-parametric regressions of wages on productivity

KS-workers.R = pooled and Monte Carlo worker-level analysis of the labor market, including scenario statistics comparison, wage, skills and unemployment duration empirical plots and fits to Gaussian, Laplace, log-normal and Subbotin distributions

KS-elementary-effects-SA.R = Morris elementary effects sensitivity analysis of the selected model responses for all model parameters, including sensitivity coefficients estimation and significance, for both linear and nonlinear effects

KS-kriging-sobol-SA.R = global Sobol variance-based sensitivity analysis using a Kriging meta-model, including alternative meta-model kernels selection, meta-model estimation and validation, Sobol variance decomposition for direct and interactive effects, and surface response plotting (2D and 3D) of top-influential factors

Other support scripts exist in the R subdirectory and are required by the above scripts. The scripts are configured to use the R subdirectory as the R working directory. Please add all the data required for the analysis (including LSD configuration files) in subdirectories inside the R working directory (the default is 'data'). There is a pair of preconfigured test configurations (Sim1.lsd and Sim2.lsd in the data subdirectory) which can be executed in LSD and analyzed by the R scripts without any change. Subdiretctories 'ee' and 'sobol' contain test configurations for sensitivity analysis scripts.

The R scripts require the following R packages (and dependencies) to be installed from the standard repositories: LSDsensitivity, tseries, normalp, nortest, mFilter, np, matrixStats, gplots, rmutil, plotrix, extrafont.
